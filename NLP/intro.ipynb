    "#tf-idf = Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "# It is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).\n",
    "# It is commonly used in information retrieval and text mining to evaluate the relevance of a term to a document.\n",
    "# The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to reduce the weight of common words that appear frequently across many documents.\n",
    "# The tf-idf score is calculated by multiplying the term frequency (TF) of a word in a document by the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the word across the entire corpus.\n",
    "# The TF is the number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in that document, while the IDF is the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the word.\n",
    "# The resulting tf-idf score is a measure of how important a word is to a specific document in relation to the entire corpus."
